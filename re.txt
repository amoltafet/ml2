I have also attached .ipynb file in the repo. You can download and run it in your local machine.

## 2. Local installation

To run the code on your local machine, you can install Jupyter Notebook or any other code editor that supports Python. You will also need to install the following libraries:

1. Numpy
2. Matplotlib
3. random


You can install these libraries using pip

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib random
```

After installing the required libraries, you can run the code in your local machine.
